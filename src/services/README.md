# Services

The services in this directory are designed to centralize where the API calls are made. For the sake of this prototype, local mock data is used to simulate API responses.

In a production environment, it is recommended to use an HTTP client like [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) to retrieve data from a proper backend.
